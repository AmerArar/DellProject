# Manage_Virtual_Machines
Project for Dell EMC 
                  Mange virtual machines
                  
We create   a  system  which enable users to manage multiple VMs per a user and In order to do that the system will create a set of VMs.
 The system consist a  backend component.

Introduction

Here at boot camp Appleseedâ€™s we develop tools for help Engineers to protect their data .
System Requirements

We describe the system requirement in an incremental fashion using the notion of steps.:

Step 1

In this step, we manage a single virtual machine:

We work with VSphere 6.5 and ESXI 6.5

We create a virtual machine on ESXI 6.5 and save the VM Data on Data Base SQL Express, and get all VMs by user.

We delete a virtual machine from ESXI 6.5 and from SQL Express and Extend VM life if needed.
