                  Mange virtual machines
Mange virtual machines is a project, which enable users to manage multiple VMs per a user and In order to do that the system will create a set of VMs. The system consist a management console (UI) and backend component.

Introduction

Here at boot camp Appleseedâ€™s we develop tools for help Engineers to protect their data To make things simple we define that the system can create max three virtual machines in single Request.

System Requirements

We describe the system requirement in an incremental fashion using the notion of steps.:

Step 1

In this step, we manage a single virtual machine:

We work with VSphere 6.5 and ESXI 6.5

We create a virtual machine on ESXI 6.5 and save the VM Data on Data Base SQL Express, and get all VMs by user.

We delete a virtual machine from ESXI 6.5 and from SQL Express and Extend VM life if needed.
